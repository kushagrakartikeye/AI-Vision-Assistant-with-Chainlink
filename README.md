## ‚ú® What It Can Do

Here‚Äôs every major feature and capability of this project:

- **Real-time Face Recognition with YOLOv8**: Instantly recognizes and identifies faces from your webcam.
- **Object Detection**: Detects and labels objects in the camera feed using YOLOv8.
- **Face Registration with Blockchain Storage**: Registers new users by capturing their face and storing a unique hash on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Auto-Sketch Generation (Pencil and Pixel Art)**: Automatically converts detected faces into artistic sketches.
- **AI Art Generation using Stability AI**: Generates images from text prompts using state-of-the-art AI models.
- **Chainlink VRF Integration for Verifiable Randomness in NFT Minting**: Ensures NFT minting is provably random using Chainlink VRF.
- **IPFS Storage for Decentralized NFT Metadata**: Stores NFT images and metadata on IPFS via Pinata for true decentralization.
- **Voice Interaction with Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech**: Lets you interact by voice‚Äîboth speaking and listening.
- **Contextual Chatbot powered by OpenRouter AI**: Answers your questions, provides context-aware responses, and assists with commands.
- **Real-time Cryptocurrency Price Display via Chainlink Data Feeds**: Shows live ETH and BTC prices directly from Chainlink.
- **NFT Minting with Chainlink VRF on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**: Mints unique NFTs with verifiable randomness, all on testnet for safe experimentation.
- **User-friendly GUI with Tkinter**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for all features.
- **Manual and Automatic Face Registration**: Register faces either manually or automatically when new faces are detected.
- **Sketch and AI Art Display in Separate Windows**: View generated sketches and AI art in dedicated windows for better user experience.
- **Integration with Alchemy Ethereum RPC**: Connects seamlessly to the Ethereum network for blockchain operations.
- **Secure Key Management via Environment Variables**: Keeps your API keys and private data safe using `.env` files.
- **Modular Code Structure for Maintainability**: Well-organized codebase for easy updates and collaboration.
- **Performance Optimizations for Real-time Processing**: Efficient algorithms for smooth, real-time operation.
